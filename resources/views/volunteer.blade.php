                <p>Being directly involved with the homeless community is an important part of our mission, and by making our care packages available to those who need them we are able to share our stories and energies as well. The opportunity to directly impact the lives of others has made us realize how deeply connected we are with each other through the humanity that binds us. Those willing to participate in this experience by either bag assembly or distribution of the bags in New York City, please contact us through the email listed below. We can use the extra hands! </p>
