                <p>The approximate cost of each drawstring bag containing hygiene products and sustainable snacks is $15, but having access to essential items is priceless for those who cannot afford them. Financial contributions are greatly appreciated and can be sent through <strong><a href="https://venmo.com/theconnectinghumanityproject">Venmo</a></strong>, or through <strong><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-connecting-humanity-project">GoFundMe</a></strong>.</p>
                <p>We are currently a local project based out of north New Jersey supplying necessities primarily for the homeless of New York City, and are able to travel to Sussex, Morris, Essex, or Warren counties to accept donations of lightly used clothing or any of the hygiene supplies that are listed in the above section. Any pick up for donations of clothes or hygiene supplies can be arranged through contacting us through email at theconnectinghumanityproject@yahoo.com. Thank you for your support, it goes a long way.</p>
