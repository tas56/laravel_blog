                <h1>Our Mission</h1><br />
            <p>Each person is on a journey that is unique to their situation and perspective, and often we become so consumed by our personal narratives that we do not consider the realities of those outside our immediate vision. People are suffering, specifically in large cities where affordable housing can be difficult to find. As of April 2020, there were 60,422 recorded homeless people, including 20,494 homeless children, all living in just New York City alone. While some are able to stay in shelters, thousands are unsheltered and left to sleep in public spaces which are often unsafe. It can be challenging to find a restroom and to have access to running water. It is through understanding these challenges we can begin to help in the most effective way possible.</p>

            <p><strong>The Connecting Humanity Project aims to have meaningful interactions with homeless communities in order to provide basic supplies and a genuine human connection.</strong> In reaching out to our local friends, family, coworkers and classmates we have had the opportunity to raise funds and accept donations of supplies for hygiene care packages and lightly used clothing. The care packages we have been making include: </p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Drawstring bag to hold everything</li>
                <li>Body wipes</li>
                <li>Lotion</li>
                <li>Toothbrush/Toothpaste</li>
                <li>Mouthwash</li>
                <li>Feminine Hygiene Products</li>
                <li>Deoderant</li>
                <li>Chapstick</li>
                <li>Socks</li>
                <li>Haircomb</li>
                <li>Granola Bars</li>
                <li>An encouraging note</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>Providing these bare necessities to the community is met with such gratitude and appreciation. It is beyond humbling to see your fellow human rejoice over a new pair of socks. It is through the generosity and understanding of those who are in a position to give back that these moments are made possible.</p>
